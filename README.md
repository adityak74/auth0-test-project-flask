## About

This project provides a basic setup for implementing Auth0 authentication in a Flask web application. Auth0 is a powerful authentication and authorization platform that allows you to add authentication features quickly and easily to your web applications.

Features:
- User authentication using Auth0.
- Auth0 configuration and management.
- Sample routes to demonstrate authentication.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityak74/auth0-test-project-flask.git
   cd auth0-test-project-flask
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure Auth0:

   - Create an Auth0 account and set up an application.
   - Update the `config.py` file with your Auth0 configuration details.

5. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

The application demonstrates how to protect routes using Auth0 authentication. You can customize and expand it to suit your project's requirements. Refer to the code and the official Auth0 documentation for more information on how to use Auth0 in your Flask application.
